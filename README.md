# User-Centric Determination of Malicious Insiders at Granular Level Using Machine Learning

## Abstract

Malicious insider attacks are seldom considered while network system security issues are discussed
and thus remain a challenge that is yet to be mastered. A vast number of organizations and
government agencies would benefit from a state-of-the-art insider threat detection system.
An ML-based system that scrutinizes the levels of data granularity, with limited onshore monitoring,
on different training settings is proposed. Four different algorithms - Logistic Regression (LR),
Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XG) are utilized. A minute analysis of
common insider threat cases is offered, along with various performance measures, to aid in the fair
assessment of system stability.

The proposed model is trained and validated using the Insider Threat Test Dataset synthesized by the
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.

**KEYWORDS**: Malicious insider, Data granularity, Insider Threat Test Dataset.
